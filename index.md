## Portfolio

I apply my data science skills to design, develop, implement and integrate innovative solutions for geospatial information and positioning systems. Currently studying a MSc in Data Science in Barcelona Tech UPC School, where I learned how to use advanced tools and techniques for data engineering, analysis, management, and visualization. I have a background in geospatial technologies, with a master degree from Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster and Universidade Nova de Lisboa, an specialization in Statistics and a bachelor's degree in engineering from Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas. I have over 15 years of work experience in the field, working for different National Agencies in Colombia as the Instituto Geográfico Agustín Codazzi, the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística, the Agencia Nacional para la Reintegración, the Bogota Cadaster and the Oil industry. I have strong analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills, and I am passionate about using data to support decision-making and improve social and environmental outcomes. I am always eager to learn new technologies and methods, and to collaborate with diverse and dynamic teams.

### [Applied research and innovation projects for geospatial data management](/idi_projects)

My background comes from geospatial data (vector and raster), statistical data and its integration with alternative sources in applied research and innovation projects. It implies the understanding and application of different techniques for data analysis using statistical methods, machine Learning and AI algorithms.

### Production and analysis of georeferenced data

But before making data science and on a daily basis in my career, I am always involved in retrieving, collecting, structuring and visualizing geographic data, also known as geospatial, geolocated, georeferenced, or location-based data. These are some examples:


- [Geopandas analysis](https://github.com/drgalindog/dianarocioprojects/tree/main/Python)
- [R dashboard with map](https://github.com/drgalindog/dianarocioprojects/tree/main/R)
- [Some map thumbnails collection](/images/thumbnail_2.jpg)

### Data reduction, segmentation, classification, prediction and visualization

Here, are some of the projects where I have worked with where the main objective is not focused on the geospatial side of the data, I love to cluster/segmentation, classify and predict.
