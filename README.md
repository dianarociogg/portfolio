Welcome to my GitHub

My name is Diana, I am a Colombian Cadastral Engineer also geodesist currently focused on projects involving business analytics, data science and data management. I am passionate about applying modelling techniques to support decision-making and provide data-driven valuable information. I am always keen about working with segmentation, classification and prediction of different types of data.

Throughout my career I have worked with different areas and fields data allowing me to strengthen my capabilities in source integration and exploitation in innovation and applied research projects. My background has given me a strong proficiency with spatial data. This involves understanding and applying varied data analysis and inference techniques, including statistical methods, machine learning, and AI algorithms to solve challenges related to the exploitation of georeferenced data for decision-making and, in general, associated with geospatial data throughout its value chain. I love to work in multidisciplinary teams, it always enriches my human and personal dimension.

Currently, I am finishing an MSc in data science which I decided to take to strengthen my business analytics and data management from an IT services and informatics side. You can find more detailed information about my training and experience in a copy of my current CV. Also, you can find some of my codes for the projects I have worked with available on various repositories or ask to me directly references.
