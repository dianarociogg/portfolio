## Applied research and innovation projects for geospatial data management

During my professional career, I have had the opportunity to develop and lead applied research, innovation and development projects for different institutions in Colombia. In theses cases, with the work team in charge, we developed projects where my main function included designing strategies, in some cases, establishing the techniques to be used and also, to make diffussion and positioning the results with different stakeholders as to accompany and technically guide the projects, here are some of the most relevant projects and results (in spanish): 

- [Deep Learning applied to the classification of construction typologies](https://ciaf.igac.gov.co/sites/ciaf.igac.gov.co/files/ciaf/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0007_deeplearning.jpg)
- [Methodology for obtaining and analyzing real estate data using alternative sources](https://ciaf.igac.gov.co/sites/ciaf.igac.gov.co/files/ciaf/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0008_webscraping.jpg),
- [Optimization for digital soil mapping](https://ciaf.igac.gov.co/sites/ciaf.igac.gov.co/files/ciaf/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0003_mapeosuelos.jpg)
- [Evaluation of object-based classification in the generation of basic cartography 1:10,000](https://ciaf.igac.gov.co/sites/ciaf.igac.gov.co/files/ciaf/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0005_calsifiobjetos.jpg)
- [Built-up area change detection](https://ciaf.igac.gov.co/sites/ciaf.igac.gov.co/files/ciaf/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0001_deteccioncambios.jpg)
- [Strengthening Colombia's Spatial Data Infrastructure](https://www.icde.gov.co/)
- [Diffusion and transfer of knowledge in geospatial technologies](https://semanageomatica.igac.gov.co/2020/)


During the development of my academic career, I have been very interested in segmentation, processing and classification algorithms for Earth Observation data:

- [Merging multispectral and pancromatic bands of landsat using cokriging](https://novaresearch.unl.pt/en/publications/merging-multispectral-and-pancromatic-bands-of-landsat-using-cokr-2)
